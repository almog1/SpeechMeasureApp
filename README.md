This is part of speech rate measure project. <br />
In this client-server web-application , you can upload/record audio file , and get the predicted SPS(Syllables Per Second). <br />
We used ML model to predict, for further information about the Machine Learning model we used and its creation, you can find [here](https://github.com/Jenny-Smolensky/ML-SpeechRateMeasure.git) <br />
